GSE186341,!Series_overall_design = 1728 RNAseq profiles of a cell-line perturbed with 32 kinase inhibitors.  Cell-lines were treated at a 48-hour IC20 for each drug and RNA was collected at 24 hours to minimize cell-death.   Samples were prepared and sequences in batches of 96 that included 6 vehicle (DMSO) and 6 water controls.   2 replicates were taken for each drug-cell-line pair.

GSE118448,"!Series_overall_design = HSAEC, A549 and HCT116 cells derived from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were subjected to 1.0µM PG treatment for 24 hours in vitro (biological triplicates). Total RNA was extracted and mRNA was purified with the Illumina® TruSeq® Stranded messenger RNA Sample Prep Kit. The library preparation output which was cDNA fragments were paired-end sequenced at read lengths of 100 nucleotides via the Illumina® HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) platform."
GSE110397,"!Series_overall_design = For RNA-seq analysis of transcriptional changes after drug treatment of human KRAS mutant lung and pancreas cancer cell lines, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) from cell lines following 8 day treatment with vehicle (DMSO), trametinib (25 nM), palbociclib (500nM), or both in combination. For RNA-seq analysis of transcriptional changes in Natural Killer (NK) cells in vivo, total RNA was extracted as described above from CD45+CD3-NK1.1+ NK cells sorted from the lungs of tumor bearing KP transplant mice following 1 week treatment with vehicle or combined trametinib (1 mg/kg body weight) or palbociclib (100 mg/kg body weight). PolyA mRNA was selected using beads coated with polyT oligonucleotides. Purified polyA mRNA was subsequently fragmented, and first and second strand cDNA synthesis performed using standard Illumina mRNA TruSeq library preparation protocols. Double stranded cDNA was subsequently processed for TruSeq dual-index Illumina library generation. For sequencing, pooled multiplexed libraries were run on a HiSeq 2500 machine on RAPID mode. Approximately 10 million 76bp single-end reads were retrieved per replicate condition. Resulting RNA-Seq data was analyzed by removing adaptor sequences using Trimmomatic (29), aligning sequencing data to GRCh37.75(hg19) with STAR (30), and genome wide transcript counting using HTSeq (31) to generate a RPKM matrix of transcript counts."
GSE122168,"!Series_overall_design = RNA-seq of A549, HCC366, NCI-H1650, and NCI-H196 cells after CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of ADAR as compared to a control gene. A549 cells were also treated with vehicle or interferon-β for 24 hours prior to collection for RNA-seq."
GSE109821,!Series_overall_design = Gene expression from microarray and RNAseq data was used to compare resistant and sensitive NSCLC lines. The microarray data was a subset from GSE32036. RNA-seq raw data are only available for samples GSM2970438-GSM2970449 (those produced at GeneWiz). The submitter states that the raw data for samples GSM2970450-GSM2970491 will be made available under controlled access at dbGaP.  The RNAseq data for GeneWiz samples is linked to Bioproject PRJNA431789 with SRA accession SRP131505
GSE103331,"!Series_overall_design = HBEC cells treated with 10 µg/ml CSC for 10 months. Control (DMSO treated) and CSC treated cells were harvested at 10 days (acute exposure) and 10 months (chronic exposure) and processed for ChIP to examine genome wide enrichment of H3K4me3, H3k27me3 and binding of DNMT1 and EZH2. ChIPed DNA was analyzed by ChIP-seq."

Each of these 12 cell lines were treated with DMSO or trametinib for 24 hours (duplicates)"

Mice were sacrificed on the onset of shortness of breath. We generated genome-wide expression profiles (RNA-seq) and Nuclease Accessibility (NA)-seq in primary KP and KPE tumor cells. NA-seq was also performed in A549 cells.
GSE64098,!Series_overall_design = Total RNA was extracted from lung adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H1975 and HCC827 (3 independent samples for each cell line) and mixed in known ratios. Both mRNA and Total RNA transcriptomes from these mixtures were profiled by RNA-Seq.
