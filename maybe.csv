GSE174850,Species specific RNA-seq performed in control (C2) and resistant (R2) human cell populations growing in mouse brain when treated with vehicle or osimertinib. There are 6 in vivo sample groups each with 3-4 reps. The same control and resistant cell populations growing in culture and treated with vehicle or osimertinib were also sent for sequencing (3 reps each).
GSE140940,Examination of chromatin accessibility and transcriptome following genetic and/or chemical perturbation of lung cancer cells
GSE159546,"Examination of lung cancer cell transcriptome, GR-chromatin binding, and looping at CDKN1C locus and CERES enhancer following treatment with glucocorticoids."
GSE150999,Mapping of superenhancers and transcription factor binding sites in a panel of small cell lung cancer preclinical models based on chromatin-immunoprecipitation of an histone modification and 3 transcription factors.
GSE130140,"We collected a total of 793 CTCF ChIP-seq datasets, including 787 public datasets and 6 datasets we generated. 771 CTCF ChIP-seq datasets with peaks more than 2,000 were used in this study. We identified specific CTCF binding patterns in six distinct cancer types, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer (BRCA), colorectal cancer (CRC), lung cancer (LUAD) and prostate cancer (PRAD). We characterized a series of genomic and epigenomic features of cancer-specific CTCF binding events using multi-omics profiling techniques including WGS, TF and histone modification ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, bisulfite sequencing, and in situ Hi-C."
GSE119978,"To identify regulations of IPA isoform expression relative to the last exon of genes in the processes of cisplatin response and resistance, we performed 3'-seq analyses and compared cisplatin-treated versus mock cells, and  cisplatin-resistant versus sensitive cells (all conditions in triplicates)."
GSE103734,"Examination of  histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications in K562, H1299 cell-lines and in inner cell mass and trophoectoderm of blastocyst stage bovine embryos"
GSE111320,Sequencing data was generated using Hiseq 2500 with a library of 101 paired end reads in the rapid run mode
