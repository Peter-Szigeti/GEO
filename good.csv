GSE208858,Tumor biopsies collected either before or after utomilumab treatment were subjected to RNA-seq analysis
GSE181820,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples from twenty-two patients were analyzed with RNA sequencing.
GSE71661,"Three separate compartments of plasma (whole plasma, EV and EV-free plasma) from a small number of malignant intermediate pulmonary nodules (IPN) patients with benign (N=10) or malignant Stage IA/B IPNs (N=7)"
GSE148801,"We divided 30 cases into 2 groups. The first group had 20 cases and was composed of relatively indolent histological subtype, such as lepidic, acinar, and papillary (good-prognosis group). The second group had 10 cases and was composed of relatively aggressive subtype, such as micropapillary and solid (poor-prognosis group). We compared the levels of gene expression profiles between 2 groups."
